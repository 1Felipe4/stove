          <h4>Electric Stove</h4>
          <p>These stoves are much less of a fire hazard, due to the fact that they don't
          use a real fire. This would be a big plus for Grandma as it's one less thing to
        worry about.</p>

        <h4>Two Burners</h4>
        <p>A 2 Burner Stove would be easier for her to use. She has to choices really.
        It would be easy to put pots and pans onto the burners, which do come in different
        sizes to cater for variation in pot sizes. The pots are then easy to take off
        the stove as their are less clutter.
        The burner changes color based on temperature ranges to remind grandma of the set
        when she sees it.

        <h4>Temperature Display And Control</h4>
        <p>This prototype uses a slide interface to control the temperature of each
           burner, and a guage to indicate the set temperature.</p>
